    "        * 200 2D structures of the HIV-1 TAR (see: ```RNA Folding HIV-1 TAR```): ```data/states_HIV_TAR.sav```    \n",
    "* **Tasks**:\n",
    "    1. Train a neural network model to predict chemical shifts from 2D structures\n",
    "    2. Determine the uncertainity of the model by applying it the testing data\n",
    "    3. Load the saved states of the HIV-1 TAR\n",
    "    4. Predict and store chemical shifts for each state\n",
    "    5. Format and write files need for BME\n",
    "    6. Use BME to determine weights\n",
    "    7. Determine the conformer with the height weight.\n",

    "* **Question**:\n",
    "    * What is the dominant state? How does it compare to the native 2D structure of TAR? If different, explain why."
